# lemon tuesday countdown

Lemon Tuesday originates from when the first lemon tree bore the first lemon on
the third Tuesday of February, though because of polar shifting and leap years
it now falls in November. The tree said that the lemon was the fruit of truth
and knowledge and that we should thank it. The people decided that they would
listen to the tree because if a tree could talk it was probably saying something
important. Over time, Lemon Tuesday strayed from its orginal purpose and became
something about a rabbit and an old man that likes red and giving out candy and
toys. To practice Lemon Tuesday, simply raise up a lemon and say,

*"Thank you lemon, for truth and knowledge."*
