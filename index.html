      <h1>What is Lemon Tuesday?</h1>
      <p id="description">Lemon Tuesday originates from when the first lemon tree bore the
        first lemon on the third Tuesday of February, though because of polar shifting and
	leap years it now falls in November. The tree said that the lemon was the fruit of
	truth and knowledge and that we should thank it. The people decided that they would
        listen to the tree because if a tree could talk it was probably saying something
        important. Over time, Lemon Tuesday strayed from its orginal purpose and
        became something about a rabbit and an old man that likes red and giving out
        candy and toys. To practice Lemon Tuesday, simply raise up a lemon and say,
        "Thank you lemon, for truth and knowledge."
